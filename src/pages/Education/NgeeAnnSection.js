            Being in this course has allowed me to grow in my skillset, as well 
            as my project management. Working with like-minded peers on projects
            such as penetration testing a website and performing digital forensics
            helped me to develop skillsets for both offensive and defensive
            security through experiential learning.

            Apart from studies, joining my school's cybersecurity club gave me
            opportunities to build my interpersonal skills with the role of a 
            Technology Lead. I strive to make learning about cybersecurity fun and
            practical for the club members through hosting workshops and organising 
            competitions.

                where we got to meet and compete against teams all across ASEAN
                in a half-day capture-the-flag competition.

                We were exposed to Splunk, a technology that allowed us to quickly
                search log files and other structured data in a system. We had to
                use Splunk to analyse data of various systems, such as web server
                logs, Windows event logs, and data from a physical access control
                system, to hunt down a fictional APT.

                This CTF not only challenged me technically, but I learnt how to
                manage my time as a solo team - to prioritise certain challenges
                over others.

                The challenges I found to be the best quality came from the 
                digital forensics category, which involved certain techniques that
                were new to me.

                The school of has given us multiple opportunities to give back to 
                the community, such as by hosting workshops about using technology 
                for the elderly, which was what I was involved in.

                In the end, the interactions with the elderly were wholesome and
                provided me with a different perspective on technology use and the
                importance of educating the public on cybersecurity.

                As a result, this motivated me for the year to come and I decided

                offered by the school to prepare myself for university.

                the skills of my teammates, led us to top 10!

                The CTF experience is great - from staying up all night to scrolling

                It was at this CTF that I felt the most defeated, but doing so
                as a team makes it worth a while. When we managed to solve a 
                "mid-tier" challenge (which at this point the university teams are
                2000 points ahead of us), we rejoiced and called it a day!
